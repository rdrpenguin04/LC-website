Lightning Creations
===================
We make cool stuff!

This webpage is a project initiated by none other than MatthewJ217, and it is the official webpage of the unofficial Lightning Creations, started by Rdrpenguin. Need more description? Well, fine. We make all sorts of projects and programs, from a Discord bot (WIP) to operating systems for a SNES. Read the source code to see what it does. We've left plenty of comments, *right*? (Weeks later: No, we haven't. Sorry.)

### Next steps:
1.  Making things that we would use a login for.

    a. Develop forum
    
    b. Develop online game server
